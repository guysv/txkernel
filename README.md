# Attention: Repo is Not Maintained
At first I wanted to separate the base classes of ILua because other projects could potentially benefit from them.
On second thought, this is pretty far fetched at the moment, and my life maintaining ILua will be easier if I merge txkernel into it. TXKernel still lives in ILua, so be sure to pay that repo a visit!

# TXKernel
*TXKernel* is a base kernel for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) powered by [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/). TXKernel development really revolves around [ILua](https://github.com/guysv/ilua), at least for it's early stages. If your kernel is to be written in Python, I'd recommend checking out [Jupyter's repositories](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/) as they contain much more mature base classes
